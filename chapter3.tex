\chapter{Design and Implementation}

The design of the software is an MVC architecture for the main game logic components. These components are broken into two sepereate systems. The two systems are Direct Mode and Programming Mode. I will explain each one seperatly, and then explain how i implemented them both as one system. 



\section{Direct Mode Design}

Direct mode is an MVC structure, the main underlying direct mode component structure will be model. The class organizing the display of any component the user needs to see or interact with in the UI, is the view.The Direct Mode controller will allow the Programming Mode controller to access any of the methods needed.
